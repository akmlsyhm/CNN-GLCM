# CNN-GLCM
Repository for Final Year Project (2023)
1. Run GLCM_and_CNN.ipynb into Jupyter Notebook or any other program that can run Python codes.
2. Do the same thing to Fish_Reco2.ipynb.
3. GLCM_and_CNN.ipynb will extract GLCM features from the images, the output of the file will be named according to your liking, for mine, its GLCM.csv.
4. GLCM_and_CNN.ipynb and Fish_Reco2.ipynb will also gives the accuracy of the model, though the accuracy actually depends on the model's training phase, such as how many epochs its training.
